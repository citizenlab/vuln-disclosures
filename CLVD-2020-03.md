## Product Affected

[COVID-KAYA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.who.COVIDKAYA) (Web application)

## Summary

A vulnerability in the web app’s authentication logic allowed access to sensitive data normally protected by a superuser login credential.

## Impact

This vulnerability allowed an attacker to access at least the names and locations of health centres, as well as the names of over 30,000 healthcare providers who have signed up to use the app. We are concerned but did not confirm that an attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the app to reveal sensitive patient data.
