# [CLVD-2020-05] Staysafe PH Android Hard Coded Credential and Sensitive Data Disclosure

* **Report:** [Unmasked II: An Analysis of Indonesia and the Philippines Government-launched COVID-19 Apps](https://citizenlab.ca/2020/12/unmasked-ii-an-analysis-of-indonesia-and-the-philippines-government-launched-covid-19-apps/) 
* **Date Published:** December 21, 2020

## Product Affected

[Staysafe PH Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ph.staysafe.mobileapp) version 0.12

## Summary

By capturing its network traffic, we observed StaySafe PH accessing a Firebase Database. We were able to identify an authentication token used by the app, and with that token had the ability to access all records from that database. 

## Impact

This vulnerability would allow an attacker to access the backend database used by the app, which contains a user’s universally unique identifier (UUID) and their geolocation coordinates. Using a separate API at https://ws.staysafe.ph/api/v1/me/trace-registrants, we found that we can also query a user’s self-reported health status (normal, having symptoms, etc.) by UUID.
